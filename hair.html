                  To start with, for you to have that successful nation, you always have to take the youth into consideration and the work of the youth, so per my suggestion to that. 
                  I think you should introduce a system that will pay a minimize worker per hour (maybe let say 5 cedis per hour), my reason being that, Our labour system is been 
                  cheated and those who does nothing takes the credit(In the name of CEO’s ), one company I will make mention of is B5 steel company in Tema, I leant people go through
                  hell before the day ends but their salaries are just for a daily bread,

                  Also, to add up, our current world is really moving very fast with the use of information, technology and machines as a whole. I will love you take a good at our current 
                  world and were the world is headed now and please stop some Subject in our basic school and make I.C.T. and most and a compulsory subject for the future youths because I 
                  believe each and everybody has a unique talent to give his country or nation, each and everybody awesome and got great inside him or her to provide in the world of I.C.T., 
                  also encourage the youths to learn about computer science from the basic level and help them understand the role of computer playing in our current world, also support 
                  those in the tertiary level to become great programmers.
